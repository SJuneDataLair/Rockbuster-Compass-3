Here is a SQL query of a common table expression:

With average_amount_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_amount_paid) AS
  (SELECT A.customer_id AS top_customer_id,
  B.first_name,
  B.last_name,
  D.city,
  E.country,
SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B on A.customer_id=B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id=C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id=D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E on D.country_id=E.country_id
WHERE city IN ('Aurora','Acua','Citrus Heights','Iwaki','Ambattur','Shanwei','So Leopoldo','Teboksary','Tianjin','Cianjur')
GROUP BY A.customer_id,
B.first_name,
B.last_name,
D.city,
E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid)
FROM average_amount_cte
